# DisBot ‚Äì Usage Rights

Hey!  
If you'd like to use DisBot on your own Discord server or even recommend it to others ‚Äì awesome! My goal is to give every server owner the ability to self-host DisBot ‚Äì including database, bot, API, and (optional) dashboard ‚Äì for example, via Docker.

**But important:**  
I don‚Äôt want my work to be copied, misused, sold, or rebranded by third parties without permission. DisBot is a community project, not a business model for outsiders.

## ‚úÖ Allowed
- Private use on your own server
- Self-hosting via Docker (if you have the necessary resources)

## ‚ùå Not Allowed
- Reselling or offering DisBot as a service
- Presenting the bot as your own product

## üí¨ Commercial Use?
Commercial use is only permitted with prior approval.  
Please contact me directly ‚Äì or alternatively use:

- [DisBot Ultra](https://disbot.app/ultra)  
- [DisBot (public bot)](https://discord.com/users/1063079377975377960)

Enjoy using DisBot! ‚ù§Ô∏è
